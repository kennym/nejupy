This project is an open-source web application for organizing
programming competitions

Contestants are able upload source code solutions to problems
specified for the competition, which can then be viewed by human
judges.

The code submissions will be compiled and executed with the help of
the `Ideone`_ `API`_

The web application is intended to be run as an instance on a server
with web servers like `Apache`_ or `nginx`_.

The code is mostly written in `Python`_, and is powered by
the `Django`_ web framework.
